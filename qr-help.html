                <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the QR Attendance app, QR codes are crucial in tracking attendance for school events and classes.</p>
        <h2>Online Mode Attendance:</h2>
        <p>1. The administrator can delegate someone to help scan the QR codes by providing them with an attendance code that they can join in. The authorized person can now help on scanning QR Codes.</p>
                <p>To join as a scanner, click the <b>+</b> button, then <b>Join Attendance</b>.</p>
        <p>2. Only the attendance administrator will have access to the full attendance contents.</p>
        <p>3. Other people assigned as scanners will only see the QR code that they have scanned. This ensures privacy and prevents unauthorized access to entire attendance records.</p>

        <h2>Scanning QR Code:</h2>
        <p>The scanner's border will initially be <a style="color:#0f9af7">blue</a>. It will change to <a style="color:#3ca832">green</a> once a valid QR Code is scanned, and turn <a style="color:#ed344a">red</a> if the QR Code is already added (Offline Mode). See <i><b>QR Codes</b></i> below for more information.
        <p>When a valid QR code is successfully scanned, the scanner will pause the scanned QR code in the frame. To continue scanning, please tap the screen.</p>
                
        <h2>Exporting Attendance:</h2>
        <p>The contents of the attendance can be exported to an <b>Excel file</b>. The exported Excel file can be found in the Downloads and then in the <b>"Attendance"</b> folder of the phone's storage.</p>
        <p>Scanned QR codes that are past the set Cutoff time in the attendance would have a <a style="background-color: #ed344a; color:#FFFFFF">red</a> background color in its Date and Time Scanned field in the excel file.</p>
        <b>For online attendances:</b>
        <p>The attendance administrator can export the entire contents of the attendance, but participants can only export the QR codes they scanned.</p>

        <h2>QR Codes:</h2>
        
        <p>Before, the QR Codes accepted by the app were either those generated by the app itself or those that adhered to the format of <b>ID Number&Fullname&Department</b>. </p>
        <p>In the new update coming this August 2nd, QR Codes that contain either the ID Number or full name will be accepted by the scanner. This will help other users utilize the QR Attendance without the hassle of creating QR Codes that adhere to the format.</p>
        <p>The QR Codes can be created in <b>Offline Mode</b>, which can be saved to phone storage in the <b>Downloads</b> inside the <b>QRCodes</b> folder.</p>
